## Package conflict error

Package conflict error occurs when we try to install or update the same application with apk but the new apk is signed by different key with the previous version. We can always uninstall the previous version and do a fresh install. However, if we want to avoid a fresh installation, we need to sign the new apk with the same key. 

## Keystore location

There are two types of apk signing - debug and release. By default, the debug keystore is located at `~/.android/debug.keystore` while the release keystore is generated by user and required a password.
